# ðŸŽµ Music Vault  

**Music Vault** is a collaborative student project developed as part of the **Software Specification and Modeling** course. The application is a **music streaming platform prototype**, inspired by Spotify, that enables users to:  

- **Browse** and discover songs, performers, and user profiles  
- **Edit** and manage music-related information  
- **Comment on** and **review** songs and artists  
- **Engage** with other users through discussions and feedback  

The primary objective of this project was to apply **UML-based software modeling techniques**, focusing on system design, specification, and analysis.
